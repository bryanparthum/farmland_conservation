The main file for conducting the analysis is `code/simulation.R`. This will provide the primary findings in the paper. Each file is stand-alone and should be self-explanatory.

## Requirements

The analysis is written in *R*. Data is stored as *.rds*.

*R* is free, open-source and available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Performance

The analyses in this paper involves many computationally intensive random parameter logit estimations. The computation time for each regression ranges from 5 to 45 minutes using 4 cores with 64GB RAM.

## Problems
